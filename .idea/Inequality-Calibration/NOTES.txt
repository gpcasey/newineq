NOTES:

- Problem with find_nextk_regimeI
	- can get negative number, depending on initial guess.
	- Hits max even for 1000 when using sigma =2.
- Still need to check all of the helper functions for finding regimeIU steady state.
- Add KTOL to functions where appproriate
- Can add finder for ss in last stage, then set KRANGE to necessarily include this level.
- Can solve for SS by hand and check that the economy converges there.
- fix nu's in pdf.
- for checking SS, can drop the economy off in a SS and make sure it stays there.
- Add an assertion for avoiding the trivial steady state.
- add derivate of ratio proof to pdf.
- add assertion for existence of second stage.
